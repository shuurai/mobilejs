# mobilejs bootstrap
A quick hybrid app ready bootstrap designed to help prototyping mobile apps quickly. The project here is designed not to replace complete web frameworks. It is more about about speeding up the process of getting a templated app structure ready where you can add a quick mobile friendly page with quick javascript tie ins. 

CanJS is the core behavior framework used for data binding and templating but other frameworks like knockout, angularjs, etc can easily be swapped in. I like CanJS because it does not rely on particular behavior javascript layer such as JQuery. The lighter weight Zepto.js can easily be dropped in.

## included components
Foundation 5.x
CanJS 2.x
JQuery 2.x

## version
Current version is 1.5 and it straps JQuery for its JS layer, and Foundation for its visual skin.
